# VishwamAI Red Team Agent

## Overview
The VishwamAI Red Team Agent is an advanced, autonomous agent designed for continuous operation, learning, and improvement. It is built to perform red team activities such as reconnaissance, exploitation, lateral movement, and exfiltration, while ensuring security and safety for humans and AI.

## Features
- **24/7 Operation**: The agent is designed to run continuously, performing tasks and learning from its environment.
- **Automatic Learning and Updates**: The agent uses machine learning techniques to improve over time and can update itself automatically.
- **Jarvis Model Integration**: The agent is augmented with advanced AI features, including natural language processing (NLP), decision-making algorithms, and optional voice interaction.
- **Secure and Safe**: The agent is built with security in mind, ensuring it poses no threat to humans or AI.

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/redteam-agent.git
   cd redteam-agent
   ```

2. **Set Up the Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Setup Script**:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

## Usage
1. **Start the Red Team Agent**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/agent.py
   ```

2. **Access the Swagger UI**:
   The Swagger UI can be accessed at `http://localhost:5000` to interact with the `cmgrd` REST API.

3. **Run the Reverse Proxy Server**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/reverse_proxy.py
   ```

## Testing
The agent can be tested using picoCTF challenges. Ensure the agent is configured to interact with the picoCTF platform and resolve challenges programmatically.

## Additional Information
- **Learning and Auto-Upgrade**: The agent is designed to learn and auto-upgrade using training rooms on the picoCTF platform. It stores its learning data for continuous improvement.
- **Configuration**: Ensure the `cmgr_interface.py` script is correctly configured to interact with the `cmgrd` server. The `base_url` should be set to `http://127.0.0.1:4200`.
- **Swagger Documentation**: The `swagger.yaml` file contains the REST API documentation for `cmgr`, detailing endpoints for managing challenges, builds, instances, and schemas.
- **Endpoints and Methods**: The `build_challenge` method uses `/challenges/{challenge_id}`, POST request, status code 200. The `start_instance` method uses `/builds/{build_id}`, POST request, status code 201. The `run_solver` method uses `/instances/{instance_id}`, POST request, status code 204.
- **CI/CD Integration**: The project includes a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions, which automates the process of checking out the code, setting up Python, installing dependencies, linting with flake8, and running tests with pytest. The CI/CD configuration can be found in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.
