# Pull Request Description

## Summary
This pull request introduces the initial implementation of the Red Team Agent for the VishwamAI project. The agent is designed to operate 24/7, perform various red team tasks, and improve over time using machine learning techniques. It includes functionalities for automatic learning, updates, and reporting.

## Key Features
- **RedTeamAgent Class**: Manages the overall operation of the agent, including task execution, data collection, and learning.
- **AutomationEngine**: Handles the execution of various red team tasks, such as reconnaissance, exploitation, lateral movement, and exfiltration.
- **LearningModule**: Uses machine learning techniques to improve the agent's performance over time. It includes methods for incremental training and model saving.
- **UpdateManager**: Manages automatic updates for the agent, ensuring it stays up-to-date with the latest improvements and security patches.
- **ReportingSystem**: Logs activities and generates reports on the agent's performance and operations.
- **PicoCTFInteraction**: Manages interactions with the picoCTF platform, including listing and solving challenges.

## Changes Made
- Implemented the `RedTeamAgent` class with methods for initialization, task execution, data collection, and stopping the agent.
- Added the `AutomationEngine` class to manage task execution.
- Integrated the `LearningModule` for machine learning functionalities.
- Added the `UpdateManager` for automatic updates.
- Integrated the `ReportingSystem` for logging and reporting.
- Implemented the `PicoCTFInteraction` class for interacting with the picoCTF platform.
- Configured logging to write logs to a file named `agent.log` in the `/home/ubuntu/VishwamAI/logs` directory.
- Added example tasks and placeholders for future tasks in the `initialize_tasks` method.
- Updated the `start` method to run tasks in a loop with a set number of iterations and ensure graceful termination.
- Enhanced the `run_tasks` method to handle errors and perform incremental training with collected data.
- Implemented the `collect_data` method to collect and validate data from tasks.
- Added the `list_challenges` method to list available challenges from the picoCTF platform.
- Updated the `stop` method to stop the agent, save the trained model, and generate a report.

## Testing
- The agent has been tested locally to ensure it initializes correctly, executes tasks, collects data, performs incremental training, and stops gracefully.
- The `PicoCTFInteraction` class has been tested to list and solve challenges on the picoCTF platform.

## Next Steps
- Replace example targets with actual targets relevant to red team operations.
- Update the data collection logic with actual data collection from red team operations.
- Implement security measures to ensure the agent operates safely and securely.
- Test the agent in TryHackMe rooms and picoCTF challenges to validate its performance and capabilities.

## Notes
- Ensure that the agent is deployed in a controlled environment and does not pose a threat to humans or AI.
- Regularly review and audit the agent's activities and updates to maintain security and compliance.
