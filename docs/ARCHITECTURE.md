# ARCHITECTURE.md

## Introduction
The purpose of this document is to outline the architecture and components of an advanced red team agent. The agent is designed to operate 24/7, continuously learning, updating, and upgrading itself to remain effective against evolving threats. It will automate various red team tasks and integrate with existing tools and frameworks to provide a comprehensive solution for adversary emulation and threat hunting.

## System Overview
The red team agent is composed of several key components that work together to achieve continuous operation and adaptability. These components include the core framework, automation engine, learning module, update manager, and reporting system. The agent will be modular and scalable, allowing for easy customization and expansion.

## Key Features
### Continuous Operation
The agent will be designed to run 24/7 without manual intervention, ensuring continuous monitoring and response to potential threats.

### Automatic Learning
The agent will incorporate machine learning algorithms to learn from its environment and past operations, improving its effectiveness over time.

### Updates and Upgrades
The agent will have a mechanism to automatically update itself with the latest tools, techniques, and security measures to stay ahead of evolving threats.

### Adversary Emulation
The agent will be capable of emulating various types of adversaries and their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to test and improve the security posture of the target environment.

### Task Automation
The agent will automate common red team tasks such as reconnaissance, exploitation, lateral movement, and reporting, reducing the need for manual intervention.

### Integration with Existing Tools
The agent will integrate with existing red team tools and frameworks, such as those found in the "infosecn1nja/Red-Teaming-Toolkit" repository, to leverage their capabilities and enhance its own functionality.

### Scalability
The agent will be designed to scale to handle various sizes of networks and numbers of targets, ensuring it can be deployed in different environments.

### Modularity
The agent will be modular, allowing for easy updates and customization of its components to adapt to specific requirements and scenarios.

### Reporting and Logging
The agent will maintain detailed logs of its activities and provide comprehensive reports on its findings, helping security teams understand and address potential vulnerabilities.

### Security and Privacy
The agent will operate securely, ensuring the privacy and integrity of the data it handles. It will implement robust security measures to protect itself and its environment.

## Component Design
### Core Framework
The core framework will provide the foundational structure for the agent, managing the interaction between its various components and ensuring smooth operation.

### Automation Engine
The automation engine will handle the execution of automated tasks, such as reconnaissance, exploitation, and lateral movement, based on predefined playbooks and scripts.

### Learning Module
The learning module will incorporate machine learning algorithms to analyze data from past operations and improve the agent's tactics and techniques.

### Update Manager
The update manager will handle the automatic updating of the agent's tools, techniques, and security measures, ensuring it remains effective against new threats.

### Reporting System
The reporting system will generate detailed logs and reports on the agent's activities and findings, providing valuable insights for security teams.

## Technology Stack
The red team agent will be built using a combination of the following technologies and frameworks:
- Python: For scripting and automation
- TensorFlow/PyTorch: For machine learning and data analysis
- Docker: For containerization and deployment
- Git: For version control and collaboration
- Various open-source red team tools: For specific tasks and capabilities

## Security Considerations
The agent will implement robust security measures to protect itself and the data it handles. This includes encryption of sensitive data, secure communication channels, and regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

## Usage Instructions
### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VishwamAI/redteam-agent.git
   cd redteam-agent
   ```

2. Set up the virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the setup script to configure the environment:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

### Running the Agent
To start the red team agent, run the `agent.py` script:
```bash
python3 agent.py
```

The agent will begin executing automated tasks and logging its activities. It will continuously run, performing reconnaissance, exploitation, lateral movement, and exfiltration tasks.

### Monitoring and Reporting
The agent's activities are logged in the `logs` directory. To generate a report, use the `ReportingSystem` class:
```python
from scripts.reporting_system import ReportingSystem

reporting_system = ReportingSystem()
report_file = reporting_system.generate_report()
print(f"Report generated: {report_file}")
```

### Customizing Tasks
To add or modify tasks, edit the `engine_template.py` file in the `scripts/automation` directory. You can define new task functions and add them to the `AutomationEngine`:
```python
def new_task(target):
    # Task logic here
    return np.array([[feature1, feature2, ..., label]])

engine.add_task(new_task, "target_ip")
```

### Updating the Agent
The `UpdateManager` class handles automatic updates. To manually trigger an update, use the following code:
```python
from scripts.update_manager import UpdateManager

update_manager = UpdateManager()
update_manager.check_for_updates()
```

### Testing in TryHackMe Rooms
To test the red team agent in TryHackMe rooms, follow these steps:

1. Set up a TryHackMe account and select the rooms you want to test the agent in.
2. Configure the agent with the target IP addresses and scenarios relevant to the selected rooms.
3. Run the agent and monitor its activities to ensure it performs the expected tasks.
4. Review the logs and reports generated by the agent to analyze its performance and identify any issues.

### Security and Safety
Ensure that the agent is deployed in a controlled environment and does not pose a threat to humans or AI. Regularly review and audit the agent's activities and updates to maintain security and compliance.

### Updating the Agent
The `UpdateManager` class handles automatic updates. To manually trigger an update, use the following code:
```python
from scripts.update_manager import UpdateManager

update_manager = UpdateManager()
update_manager.check_for_updates()
```

The `UpdateManager` reads the current version from the `version.config` file and checks for updates from a remote repository. If an update is available, it applies the update and updates the `version.config` file with the new version.
