# Jarvis Model Outline

## Overview
The Jarvis model aims to enhance the capabilities of the red team agent by integrating advanced AI functionalities such as natural language processing (NLP), decision-making algorithms, and potentially voice interaction capabilities. The model will be designed to operate 24/7, be secure, and not pose a threat to humans or AI.
